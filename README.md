Since I constntly browse random free tier API's, with amazing documentation I decided to throw everything into one pill in order to be able to access all sorts of iex cloud or alpaca tools using both Python and JS.
Tools available here will allow me to communicate between RESTful API's and my GraphQL implementation of serverside applications... For now at least that's the brief idea for this repo.
